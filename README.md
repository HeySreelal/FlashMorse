## 🤔 How it works?
We've made the user experience flow as simple as possible. The user can enter a text in the given field and the text will automatically get converted to morse code as they type. User is given two buttons to both **Flash** 🔦 and **Beep** 🔉 the converted morse code.


Steps:
1. Enter the text to be converted to morse in the input field.
2. Click on the Flash 🔦 button to start flashing the converted morse code.
3. Click on the Beep 🔊 to start beeping the converted morse code.
4. Additionally, you can click on the Clear ❌ butotn to clear the input field. Or click on the Copy button to copy the converted morse code to the clipboard.
